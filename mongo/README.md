mongo-odm
=========

Package mongo-odm provides an object document mapper, or ODM,
 for mongodb, strongly influenced by Doctrine Mongo ODM.

With mongo-odm, mongodb users no longer need to manually map related documents 
from different collections, mongo takes cares of all the busy work automatically,
making it easy to model complex data. mongo-odm is written in Go.
